## I am a seasoned facilitator
with experience working with youth, adults, neurodiverse people, and LGBTQIA+ folks. My table is a friendly, inclusive place, and I have experience with a variety of safety mechanisms to make sure everyone is having a good time.

Games can run in-person or online - there's a great deal of flexibility available.

I run everything from zany one-shots to long-running campaigns! If you have a module or adventure you'd like to play, bring it to me!

## What Are Tabletop Roleplaying Games?
TTRPGs are a door into your imagination. They're a space to live out stories in a social setting. They can be intense tactical puzzles, gut-wrenching stories, a fun social time to hang out with friends or get to know new ones, and every combination of those things. Some use extremely detailed rules, while some are more loose and improvisational.

# For Youth
Tabletop roleplaying games are a combination of creativity, teamwork skills, and problem-solving. They help develop confidence, imagination, and social skills. Create stories in fantasy, science fiction, or both! Fight monsters in the depths of ancient mines or unravel mysteries at a school for magic!

# For Adults
Tabletop games are a way to scratch that creative itch and have fun with friends. Whether you want a deep political intrigue or a crazy romp through a dungeon over beer, there's a game that can help you find the story you want, and I can guide you into and through it.

# For Organizations
For small groups, tabletop games can be a fantastic team-building exercise. One-shot games that go from character creation to conclusion in the course of a few hours can provide a ton of fun and bring a team closer together.
